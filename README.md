Bullet Hell Game w/ Mike

- 2D or 3D?
  - 3D
- Top-Down?
  - Yes
- Isometric or Regular?
  - isometric
- Input System?
  - Lets target controller for now
- Platform?
  - PC for now ( I would think with unity we can target the other main systems without too much trouble.)
- Similar Games?
  - The Ascent
  - Enter the Gungeon
  - Ikaruga
- Existing Art or just use the basic unity shapes (squares, spheres, etc.)?
  - I think while we are gettign going lets just use the basics and once we get further along we can start thinking about art

Note: Feel free to question any of these. Also, I think I want to mix the concept of bullet-hell and RPG so think less pure bullet hell and more bullet hell zelda.
